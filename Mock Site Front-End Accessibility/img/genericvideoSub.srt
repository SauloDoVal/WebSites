1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,080
We think first of vague words that are synonyms for progress

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,369
And pair them with footage of a high-speed train.

3
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,880
Science is doing lots of stuff

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,570
That may or may not have anything to do with us.

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,880
See how this guy in a lab coat holds up a
beaker?

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,800
That means we do research.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,280
Here’s a picture of DNA.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,400
There are a shitload of people in the world,

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,399
Especially in India.

10
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,939
See how we’re part of the global economy?

11
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,800
Look at those farmers in China.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,600
But we also do business in the U.S.A.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,890
Or want you to think we do.

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,000
Check out this wind energy thing in Indiana,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,100
And this blue collar guy with

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,000
dirt on his face.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Phew.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,200
Also, we care about the environment, loosely.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,900
Here’s some powerful, rushing water.

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,240
And people planting trees.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,200
Our policies could be related to these panoramic views of Costa Rica.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,640
In today’s high-speed environment,

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,600
Stop-motion footage of a city at night

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,880
With cars turning quickly

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,500
Makes you think about doing things efficiently

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,200
And time passing.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,500
Lest you think we’re a faceless entity,

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,300
Look at all these attractive people.

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,200
Here’s some of them talking and laughing.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,300
And close-ups of hands passing canned goods to each other

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,600
In a setting that evokes community service.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Equality, innovation,

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Honesty and advancement …

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,390
Are all words we choose from a list.

35
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,000
Our profits are awe-inspiring.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,990
Like this guy who’s looking up and pointing at a skyscraper or a kite

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,800
While smiling and explaining something to his child.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,900
Using a specific ratio of

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Asian people

40
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,100
to black people

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,800
to women

42
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,600
to white men, we want to make sure we represent your needs.

43
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,000
and interests.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Or at least a version of your skin color, in our ads.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,900
Did we put a baby in here?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,530
What about an ethnic old man whose wrinkled smile represents the happiness and wisdom of the poor?

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,900
Yep.
